# Heart-disease-prediction

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a logistic regression model. The model is trained on a dataset containing various medical attributes of patients, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. The objective is to provide a tool that can help in the early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, potentially saving lives through timely medical intervention.
